# Yet another DMZ cursor theme

###### ALL FOLDERS RENAMED IN LATEST UPDATE - PLEASE REMOVE OLD FOLDERS BEFORE COPYING!
----------


The purpose of this theme is to replace the black/white busy spinner ![](https://github.com/GalliumOS/dmz-cursor-theme/blob/master/DMZ-White/pngs/24x24/watch_0001.png) in the DMZ cursor theme. All icons (except the animated watch spinner icon and the pointer) is inherited from the DMZ-White theme. 

 1. For the blue **Unity8 dots** I have used [this YouTube video ](https://youtu.be/Dwxx2yQs_Ig?t=8m3s) as a reference. This one as an inner shadow.
2. This **Unity8 spinner** came from [the Ubuntu Phone documentation](https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/apps/design/building-blocks/activity-indicators). The space between the lines are transparent.
3. Same as above but orange
4. **DMZ-colored_trobber** is the standard default DMZ watch spinner, colored blue.
5. With the **orange split** I am trying a different color. Here an orange dot splitting and assembling while rotating. The #E95420 sometimes looks like red, so this one is slightly more orange.
6. Simply a rotating **Suru gear** icon.
7. These 3 dots are placed like in the Ubuntu logo. I wanted to add some color and used Suru blue, Ubuntu orange and Canonical aubergine.
8. I came across this idea and thought it was a nice mix between Microsoft's circle of dots and Apples beachball. Also with so many colors, it can be seen on any background color.
9. A orange bouncing ball. I was hoping the shadow was a bit clear, since the ball disappears on orange backgrounds.
10. A gray semi-transparent ring with an orange slice rotating.
11. A blue circle with a "wave" animation.
12. This one is taking the idea of the current "process-working-symbolic.svg".
13. This IS the actual "process-working-symbolic.svg" spinning.
13 Black - As above, but just inheriting the DMZ black cursor.

The pointer has also been replaced and should appear sharper.
